        <Paragraph>
          Pixil-Artillery consists of <b>5,000 algorithmically generated NFT
          weapons</b>, designed specifically for the blockchain. Each of these
          weapons is a completely unique NFT, with unique attributes assigned
          according to rarity. Most importantly, we are a small team that
          consists of four main individuals - a developer, two artists and a
          marketing specialist. We are a small team - but a <b>dedicated </b> 
          one, and we are continuing to work our hardest to ensure that not
          only the launch goes smoothly- but that this project has longevitity
          rewards it's intial minters.

          On our launch dates, you will be able to see the minting button go
          live. The initial mint price for one weapon is <b>0.015 ETH, or around
          $55</b> as of the making of this site.
